        <p>I'm a forever boilermaker who graduated from Purdue in 2012! At Purdue, I studied mechanical engineering and minored in global engineering. I had the opportunity to study abroad at Jiao Tong University in Shanghai and spent a summer working on a research project at University College London.</p>

        <p>My first experience with programming was in high school AP Java. I loved everything about it! Although I majored in mechanical engineering, throughout university and in to my job at Siemens Industry I always gravitated towards projects and internships that involved coding. I currently attend Dev Bootcamp in Chicago, where I am learning all about agile development and building smart, creative code.</p>

        <p>After earning my mechanical engineering degree, I worked for two years with Siemens Industry . At Siemens, I had the opportunity to work on cool technology in their drive technologies division including motors, drive systems, and the software automation that brought it all together - all while continuing to build my technical leadership ability.</p>

        <p>It all started in Chicago! Well, the south suburbs to be exact. I currently live in Peoria, IL, a few hours south of the city.</p>

        <p>When I'm not working, I want to be outside running, sprinting, or hiking with my pup! She is pretty tiny, but she can run 6+ miles on a cool day. For a while, I started and operated a dog running company with 4+ runners. It was a fun business that connected people to dog runners in their neighborhood. Now, I just enjoy the outdoors with my little dog.</p>

        <p>I love races. Half marathons, triathlons, 10Ks, obstacle courses, you name it. The longest race I've completed is the Chicago marathon, but my favorite race so far was the Olympic Triathlon I finished with my husband in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. I've been told I am very high energy, I love to always be on the go. I try to work out all that extra energy by running almost every day and doing yoga whenever I get the chance!</p>
