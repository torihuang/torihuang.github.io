    <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>
    <h2>1/19/2016</h2>

    <p>
      Arrays and Hashes are both collections used to store and retrieve data. Collections allow a programmer to save data in an organized manner, and are invaluable to preventing absolute chaos in a program! In this blog post I'll review arrays and hashes and the differences between the two.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are plenty of articles explaning the syntax of how to edit arrays and hashes. In this blog, I will review some syntax but will mainly focus on the different uses for arrays and hashes. For more information on syntax, please check the resources links at the bottom of the page!
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p>
        First, arrays! Arrays are an amazing way to organize data in numerical order. In an array, values are stored in relation to a numerical value. Arrays start at zero, and move on towards infinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, say you are trying to keep track of a list of friends. Maybe you have up to 20 friends you want to keep track of, so you always have a full list of people to invite to parties, and you want to create a program that will print out all your friend's names. You could, theoretically, just create a list of names in a string that print out.
      </p>

      <h4>Code</h4>
      <pre><code>
        friend1 = "Lucy Smith"
        friend2 = "John Carol"
        friend3 = "Brendan Sweeney"
        friend4 = "Joy Lin"
        ...

        puts friend1
        puts friend2
        puts friend3
        puts friend4
      </pre></code>

      <h4>Output</h4>
      <pre><code>
        Lucy Smith
        John Carol
        Brendan Sweeney
        Joy Lin
      </pre></code>

      <p>
        This is a pretty terrible solution to this problem. There are a ton of variables, and way too many lines of code. Plus, there is no easy way to sort through and edit your friend group. What if your friend Lucy Smith moves away, and you need to take her off the party list indefinitely? What if you met a cool new person in yoga class who promises they'll bring their cute dog to the next party, so you need to add them to the invite list? That's where arrays come in.
      </p>

      <p>
        With an array, you'll be able to sort, edit, and add to your list of friends. You can add people, delete people, and arrange names alphabetically. It is easier to organize your data. The code is more efficient. It is basically better in every imaginable way.
      </p>

      <pre><code>
        invite_list = ["Lucy Smith", "John Carol", "Brendan Sweeney", "Joy Lin", ...]

        puts invite_list
      </pre></code>

      <h4>Output</h4>
      <pre><code>
        Lucy Smith
        John Carol
        Brendan Sweeney
        Joy Lin
      </pre></code>

      <p>
        That's infinitely better! Only two lines, but the same output. Now you can delete Lucy and make sure the yoga hunk is invited to your next soiree, with less effort. You can even sort through your new array of friends and sort them. Again, arrays are ordered by number. Say you wanted to capture the first person from the list. You would access their name using <code>invite_list[0]</code>. At the moment, <code>invite_list[0]</code> would return Lucy Smith. If you wanted to access the second person, you would use <code>invite_list[1]</code> and find John Carol.
      </p>
      <p>
        However handy they may be, arrays do have their limitations. Take the invite list example. While it is very useful to have a list of friends to invite to a party, it would be even more useful to print out their name along with their email address. Is there a way to do this with arrays? Maybe, if you created an array of arrays or if you included the email with the string of their name. Would it work? Yes. Would it be messy? Double yes. There has to be an easier way to connect names with additional information. This is where hashes come in.
      </p>

      <h3>Hashes</h3>
      <p>
        Now we understand a bit about arrays, collections of objects ordered by number, let's take a look at hashes. Like arrays, hashes store information in an organized manner. Unlike arrays, hashes do not necessarily connect these objects to a numerical value. Hashes are a collection of objects, where each object is connected to a key. The key can be a number or a string. The value can be an object, or even a method.
      </p>

      <h4>Hash Example</h4>

      <pre><code>
        supporting_characters = {
          "Harry Potter" => "Hermione",
          "Shrek" => "Donkey",
          "Finding Nemo" => "Dory"
        }
      </pre></code>

      <p>
        In the example above, the movies (Harry Potter, Shrek, Finding Nemo) are the keys and the supporting characters (Hermione, Donkey, Dory) are the values. You can search for supporting characters by movie. You can search for movie by supporting characters. Hashes are amazing!
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's take a look at our invite list example for a better understanding. First, we have to create our hash.
      </p>

      <h4>Declare a hash of party information</h4>
      <pre><code>
        party_info = {
          "Lucy Smith" => "lsmith@gmail.com",
          "John Carol" => "carolboy@gmail.com",
          "Brendan Sweeney" => "bsweeney@yahoo.com",
          "Joy Lin" => "me@joylin.com",
          "Wine Bottles"=>10, "Start,
          Time" => "9:00PM"
        }

        puts supporting_characters
        puts supporting_characters.keys
        puts supporting_characters.values
      </pre></code>

      <h4>Output</h4>
      <pre><code>
        {"Lucy Smith"=>"lsmith@gmail.com", "John Carol"=>"carolboy@gmail.com", "Brendan Sweeney"=>"bsweeney@yahoo.com", "Joy Lin"=>"me@joylin.com", "Wine Bottles"=>10, "Start Time" => "9:00PM"}

        Lucy Smith
        John Carol
        Brendan Sweeney
        Joy Lin

        lsmith@gmail.com
        carolboy@gmail.com
        bsweeney@yahoo.com
        me@joylin.com
      </pre></code>

      <p>
        Now you have names and email! So handy. You can still sort, edit, and add to your hash. Not only do you have this information, but we have also snuck some additional variables in here. From this hash, you can tell that at the last party you drank 10 bottles of wine and the start time was 9:00PM. You could even write a small program to access this information at any time.
      </p>

      <pre><code>
        return party_info["Wine Bottles"]
        return party_info["Start Time"]
      </pre></code>

      <p>
        The code above will return 10 and 9:00PM, the total number of bottles purchased and start time of your last party so you know exactly how much wine to purchase and what invite time to send out! Can you imagine trying to do this with an array? There would be no way to link the information (10 bottles and 9:00PM) with any searchable value. This is why hashes are great.
      </p>

      <h3>The Real Difference between Arrays and Hashes</h3>
      <p>
        Both arrays and hashes are collections of objects. Arrays are organized numerically, while hashes are keys and values linked together. The <strong>real</strong> difference between arrays and hashes is that arrays are more like a linear storage system. The create organized lists; numbers to link to objects. Hashes are more like maps. The keys themselves hold value, and link to another object that stores even more value.

      <h3>Additional Resources</h3>
      <p>
        I hope this overview helped you understand more about the differences between arrays and hashes! There is, of course, a lot more to learn - especially when it comes to syntax. For more info on how to use arrays and hashes, please check out the links below.
