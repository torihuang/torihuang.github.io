    <h1>Online Security</h1>
    <h2>1/21/16</h2>

    <p>
      While researching online security, there were three things that really popped out. First, <strong>everyone is concerned with online security</strong>. It is an issue traversing industries, demographics, and geographical locations. Second, <strong>everyone on the team has to be aware of security</strong>. It only takes one little crack for someone to find a way in. Everyone must be involved. Finally, <strong>secure software is built from the ground up</strong>. Security in software must be a concern from day one through the program’s final days.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Online Security Effects Everyone</h3>
      <p>
        Let’s delve in to the first point. Security matters to everyone. There is no better way to understand <strong>why</strong> security matters to everyone, than to look at what happens to companies whose security has been compromised. Take a look at this website, which includes an interactive infographic of breached companies from 2006 through 2015. Seriously, you’ll want to take a look. It is pretty frightening.
      </p>

      <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/">Data Breach Interactive Infographic</a>

      <p>
        The infographic above includes organizations from Home Depot to Ebay to The US Department of Veteran Affairs to the South American Police Department, and more. Some of these organizations were the victims of a direct attack on their systems. For example, in 2009 Sony PSN saw the information breach of <a href="http://www.thewire.com/technology/2011/09/lulzsecs-sony-hack-really-was-simple-it-claimed/42851/">76 million user accounts</a> from what experts describe as a <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2386362,00.asp">very basic attack</a>. The hacker group, self proclaimed lulzsecs, says the hack was a simple sql injection. In an sql injection, the attacker enters malicious code in to an entry field linked to the target’s database. The malicious code gets uploaded to the victim’s database and the hacker is in.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea that huge companies like Sony can be so easily compromised is scary enough. Surely companies that specialize in online business must be more secure? Their entire business was built around the internet! While big online businesses may put an emphasis on secure systems, there is always that one weak link: <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/05/13/hackers-target-system-vulnerabilty-people/itLk7GJ9gKsl85puKxFNbO/story.html ">people</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the companies included in the above infographic were hacked through an interesting combination of skill and clever social engineering. For example, Ebay's customer database was breached in early February of 2015, when hackers managed to obtain login information from three employees. That's right, it only took three employees. From there, they gained access to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/cyber-thieves-took-data-on-145-million-ebay-customers-by-hacking-3-corporate-employees-2014-5">145 million customers</a>.

      <h3>It's a Team Effort</h3>
      <p>
        From the previous example, you can see it really does take the smallest of opportunities for online security to be compromised. Poor programming, database creation, or security training for employees, and the security of your entire system is at risk. This is why most security experts emphasize the importance of getting the <strong>entire</strong> team involved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Take a look at this figure from the Information System Security Certification Consortium, Inc., (ISC). This group specializes in providing information on cyber, information, software and infrastructure security. Below is a figure detailing the people from a secure business or organization typically involved in the security of their online systems.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        Get it? It’s everybody. Sure, the software developers need to build secure systems to create a good starting point, but it is still a team effort. We need managers to be aware of the dangers of poor security so they prioritize safer systems. We need product owners keeping security in mind each time they suggest a new feature. We need every employee trained on how to deal with potential security scams, so the Ebay mistake does not repeat!
      </p>

      <p>
        Security includes everybody, period.

      <h3>Security from Day One</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, we get to security from day one, 24/7. For most businesses, starting from day one means including security in your software from design through inception. Security expert Gary McGraw gives a really <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/essentialguide/How-to-develop-software-the-secure-Gary-McGraw-way">great overview</a> of secure software in this interview.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is much easier to build secure systems from the ground up, than to go back and fix mistakes. We know it only takes the tiniest crack for a system’s security to become compromised. If you look at your security online as a castle, with the potential breaches as cracks in the wall, you can see that it would be easier to build a solid wall than to go back and try to fit stones through the cracks. Plus, still using the castle analogy, if you design for security from the beginning you can plan beyond just building a secure wall, and build the castle on top of a mountain surrounded by a moat filled with crocodiles. Talk about security.

      <h3>Good Luck</h3>
      <p>
        The responsibility of online security is an ever-increasing burden for organizations everywhere. Companies around the world have experienced security breaches. The ferocity and magnitude of online attacks for customer data is only going to increase as the internet continues to grow. This is why online security is more important than ever.
