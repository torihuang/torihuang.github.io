      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>
        Thanks for checking out my site! Please take a look around. You'll find a little information about myself, my blog, and some projects I worked hard to create.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an aspiring software developer, currently studying at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> in Chicago, IL. Before being accepted to Dev Bootcamp, I tried my hand at building a dog running app that connected busy families to dog runners in their neighborhood. That didn't quite work out, but I did manage to make a pretty cool little dog running company called <a href="http://dogjog.co">Dog Jog</a> in Peoria, IL. Before that, I studied and worked as a mechanical engineer at Purdue University and for Siemens. You can find more information about projects I worked on and more at the <a href="#">Projects</a> button above.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are looking for a software developer, I would be happy to speak with you! Please get in contact with me through one of the methods listed at the bottom of my page.
