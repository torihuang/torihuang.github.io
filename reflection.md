## What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned the difference between padding, borders, and margin! Consider an element, like a paragraph. If you give that paragraph a padding of 10px on all sides, you will actually increase the size of that element, expanding it's height by 20px and width by 20 px total. This expansion is simply "white-space", although depending on the element the added padding may not be white. If you add a border, you are again adding to the external, however the additional pixels can be defined by thickness, line type, and color. Margins do not change the size of the element, but create an external baracade around the element. They basically shove everything else away based on the defined size of the margin.

## What did you learn about CSS positioning?

CSS position is pretty tricky! You need to understand parent/child relationships to know how to define elements as relative to one another. I learned that I could still work more on positioning.

## What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I found it easy to align the parent elements with each other. I found it difficult to align the children within their parent.

## What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that I still have a lot to learn! I have also been thinking about how static my page is. I am really hoping JavaScript can make it much more awesome.
